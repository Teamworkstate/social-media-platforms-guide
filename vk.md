## Overview & Core Functionality

VK (originally VKontakte, meaning "In Contact") is the largest social network in Russia and several post-Soviet states, launched in 2006 by Pavel Durov (who later founded Telegram). With approximately 100 million monthly active users, VK functions as a comprehensive social platform combining elements of Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Spotify into a unified ecosystem. The platform serves as the primary social network across Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and other Russian-speaking regions, though it has users worldwide.

At its core, VK creates value through a comprehensive social ecosystem that integrates personal profiles, content sharing, messaging, communities, and media consumption. Unlike Western platforms that often specialize in specific functions, VK provides a more all-encompassing approach where users can maintain social connections, consume entertainment, join interest groups, and access services without leaving the platform. This integrated experience reduces the need for multiple apps and creates a self-contained digital environment.

VK operates on a profile-based system similar to Facebook, where users maintain personal pages, connect with friends, join communities, and share various content types. The platform combines this social foundation with extensive media features including a robust music section, video hosting, gaming platform, and marketplace functionality. This creates a versatile ecosystem that serves both social and practical needs for its user base.
