# Telegram

## Overview & Core Functionality

Telegram, launched in 2013 by brothers Pavel and Nikolai Durov, has evolved from a secure messaging app into a comprehensive communication platform with over 900 million monthly active users. The platform combines messaging, group functionality, channels for broadcasting, and an extensive bot ecosystem to create a versatile communication tool that bridges personal messaging and public content consumption. Unlike many social platforms focused on public sharing or networks, Telegram prioritizes messaging while extending capabilities far beyond basic chat.

At its core, Telegram creates value through secure, cloud-based messaging with no limits on file sharing, extensive customization options, and powerful group capabilities. The platform's fundamental approach emphasizes speed, security, and freedom from restrictions, creating an environment that appeals to users seeking alternatives to mainstream messaging apps and social networks. This philosophy extends to its stance on content moderation, which is generally less restrictive than many platforms.

Telegram operates on a cloud-based architecture that synchronizes conversations across devices while offering end-to-end encryption as an optional feature. The platform combines private messaging, group chats (up to 200,000 members), channels for one-way broadcasting to unlimited audiences, and bots that provide automated services and interactive experiences. This creates a flexible ecosystem where private conversations, community discussions, content distribution, and utility functions coexist within a single application.
