## Overview & Core Functionality

YouTube, launched in 2005 and acquired by Google in 2006, has evolved from a simple video sharing site into the world's largest video platform and second most visited website globally. With over 2.5 billion monthly logged-in users and countless additional non-logged viewers, YouTube functions as both a social platform and the dominant video search engine. The platform hosts everything from individual creators to major media companies, educational content to entertainment, spanning virtually every topic, language, and format imaginable.

At its core, YouTube creates value through democratized video distribution and monetization. Unlike traditional media requiring significant infrastructure and distribution deals, YouTube allows anyone to upload, share, and potentially profit from video content with minimal barriers to entry. This fundamental shift has created new entertainment formats, learning opportunities, career paths, and communities that wouldn't exist in traditional media ecosystems.

YouTube operates on a channel-based system where creators establish presences through regular content uploads, while viewers subscribe to channels and receive recommendations based on their viewing history. The platform combines this subscription model with powerful search and recommendation algorithms that help users discover relevant content beyond their subscriptions. This creates a hybrid experience balancing intentional following with algorithm-driven discovery.
